# codeRefractor_h1

For this project I was sourced with an HTML and CSS file showing a website for a company 'Horiseon'. The site itself describes the offerings of a marketing company aimed at helping online retialers.

The goal of the exercise was to update the HTML and CSS to accomplish a few different things:

1. Ensure the CSS was consolidated and that there wasn't classes that duplicated each other.
2. Update the HTML so that all links were working as expected.
3. Update the HTML so that the images were accesible to visually impared users.
